// Cm is an editor C and C++ development
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------
-


// Overview
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Cm is full screen editor that based on the spirit of uEmacs sharing many 
similar command sequences and behavior.  Cm started as more of thought 
exercise on how to write a text editor. As time went on more features 
were added included syntax coloring and the ability to define projects.

// Modes of operation
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Cm is always in insert text mode.  Actions are initiated by either typing 
ESC and a command, or CNTL and one or more keystrokes.  Commands are 
typical things that require an argument to be entered.  ESC puts the 
cursor on the command line.  At this point a when a key is pressed Cm 
checks to see if it's the first character of quick access command.  For 
instance, ESC then f results in the "find:" being placed on the command 
line.  The user can then type "foo" ENTER and the cursor will jump to the 
first occurrence of "foo" past the current cursor position.

Commands entered by holding the CNTL key and pressing another key 
performs an immediate action.  For instance, CNTL-V performs a page down 
action.  In the same way, CNTL-f will repeat the last ESC-f find command 
using the same argument as the first find command was entered.

// Control Actions 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-


// Control X control functions
Control X, Control S: Save File
Control X, Control C: Quit
Control X, Control J: Toggle Jump Scroll

// Cut and paste
Control k: Cut to end of line
Control w: Cut text between mark and cursor to cut buffer
Control y: Paste cut buffer

// Cursor movement
Control v: Page Down
Control z: Page Up

// Find and Replace
ESC f: find initial
ESC r: replace initial
Control f: find again
Control r: replace again


// command sequences asking for input

ESC, ESC: enter command

ESC s: Save file
ESC c: Cut to mark
ESC q: q
ESC g: goto line

ESC SPACE: set mark
ESC m: set mark
ESC p: paste text

// misc
Control l: toggle line numbers
Control n: next buffer
Control p: preveous buffer



ESC n: asks for name of file, existing or not, creates a new buffer, sets 
it as current buffer and loads the file
       if applicable into it.

Control <SPACE>: change to next buffer

Control c : get the name of the current edit buffer, if its a .c or .cpp 
file change to .h version.  If its the .h version
            load the .cpp or .c version of the file
